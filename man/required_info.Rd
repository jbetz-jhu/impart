\title{Determine the information level required for a one-stage, fixed sample size design}
\usage{
required_information_single_stage(
  delta,
  delta_0 = 0,
  alpha = 0.05,
  sides = 2,
  power = 0.8
)

required_information_mw_single_stage(mw, alpha = 0.05, sides = 2, power = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{Numeric vector containing the estimand under the alternative hypothesis}

\item{delta_0}{Numeric vector containing the estimand under the null hypothesis}

\item{alpha}{Desired Type I Error Rate of the test}

\item{sides}{(Scalar - 1 or 2): Type of Test, either 1-sided or 2-sided.}

\item{power}{Desired power of the test (1 - Type II Error Rate)}

\item{mw}{Numeric vector containing the estimand under the alternative
hypothesis: the value of the Mann-Whitney under the null is always 0.5.}
}
\value{
When all parameters are scalars, the result is a scalar, indicating
the required information. When multiple values are specified, a grid of
unique parameters are constructed, and the required information is
computed for each value of the parameters.
}
\description{
In information monitored designs, data are accrued until the information
(i.e. precision) reaches the level required to achieve the desired power when
testing the null hypothesis against a specific alternative while maintaining
a specified Type I Error Rate.
\code{required_information_uninflated_mann_whitney} is an alias to
\code{required_information_single_stage} for ordinal outcomes, where the null
value of the Mann-Whitney estimand is 0.5.
}
\details{
The amount of information in a sample of size \eqn{N} depends on
\emph{nuisance parameters}, such as the variance of continuous outcomes,
the risk of binary and time-to-event outcomes, rates of misssing data, and
the correlation between covariates and the outcomes of interest.

In studies with a fixed sample size, this sample size is chosen based on
assumptions about these nuisance parameters, which are incorporated into the
\emph{effect size}. The sample size is chosen to give power \eqn{(1 - \beta)}
while maintaining a type I error rate of \eqn{(\alpha)} under some assumed
effect size. Inaccurate estimates of nuisance parameters can lead to
over-powered or under-powered studies.

In an information-monitored design, investigators choose an estimand of
interest, such as the difference in means or proportions, that is free from
nuisance parameters. A trial is designed to identify some minimum important
difference \eqn{\delta_{min}} in the estimand with power \eqn{(1 - \beta)}
while maintaining a type I error rate of \eqn{(\alpha)}. Data is collected
until the precision of the estimate (i.e. the reciprocal of its variance)
reaches a pre-specified threshold \eqn{\mathcal{I}}:

\deqn{\mathcal{I} = \left(\frac{Z_{\alpha/s} + Z_{\beta}}{\delta_{min}}\right)^2
\approx \frac{1}{Var(\hat{\delta})} =
\frac{1}{\left(SE(\hat{\delta})\right)^2}}

The sample size required to reach the information target \eqn{\mathcal{I}}
depends on nuisance parameters mentioned above.

This function allows a user to determine the target level of information
\eqn{\mathcal{I}} needed to detect a difference of \eqn{\delta_{min}} in the
estimand with power \eqn{(1 - \beta)} while maintaining a type I error rate
of \eqn{(\alpha)}.

\examples{
# When a single value is supplied for each parameter, a scalar is returned:
required_information_single_stage(
  delta = 5,
  delta_0 = 0,
  alpha = 0.05,
  sides = 2,
  power = 0.8
)

# When multiple values are supplied for one or more parameters, the grid of
# parameters are created, and a data.frame is returned.
required_information_single_stage(
  delta = c(5, 7.5),
  delta_0 = 0,
  alpha = 0.05,
  sides = 2,
  power = c(0.8, 0.9)
