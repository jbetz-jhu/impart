integer value?}

receiving the control intervention}

\item{pi_1}{Probability of event in the population of individuals
receiving the control intervention}

\item{delta}{The risk difference (i.e. \code{pi_1 - pi_0})}

treatment to those receiving control}
}
\value{
When all parameters are scalars, the result is a scalar, indicating
the approximate sample size requirement. When multiple values are specified,
a grid of unique parameters are constructed, and the approximate information
is computed for each value of the parameters.

\description{
These functions convert an information target into an approximate sample size
required for a single-stage fixed sample size design with the same power and
type I error requirements under assumed values of nuisance parameters.
}
\details{
The amount of information in a sample of size \eqn{N} depends on
\emph{nuisance parameters}, such as the variance of continuous outcomes,
the risk of binary and time-to-event outcomes, rates of misssing data, and
the correlation between covariates and the outcomes of interest.

In studies with a fixed sample size, this sample size is chosen based on
assumptions about these nuisance parameters, which are incorporated into the
\emph{effect size}. The sample size is chosen to give power \eqn{(1 - \beta)}
while maintaining a type I error rate of \eqn{(\alpha)} under some assumed
effect size. Inaccurate estimates of nuisance parameters can lead to
over-powered or under-powered studies.

In an information-monitored design, investigators choose an estimand of
interest, such as the difference in means or proportions, that is free from
nuisance parameters. A trial is designed to identify some minimum important
difference \eqn{\delta_{min}} in the estimand with power \eqn{(1 - \beta)}
while maintaining a type I error rate of \eqn{(\alpha)}. Data is collected
until the precision of the estimate (i.e. the reciprocal of its variance)
reaches a pre-specified threshold \eqn{\mathcal{I}}:

\deqn{\mathcal{I} = \left(\frac{Z_{\alpha/s} + Z_{\beta}}{\delta_{min}}\right)^2
\approx \frac{1}{Var(\hat{\delta})} =
\frac{1}{\left(SE(\hat{\delta})\right)^2}}

The sample size required to reach the information target \eqn{\mathcal{I}}
depends on nuisance parameters mentioned above.

These functions allow a user to determine an approximate sample size \eqn{N}
at which the information target \eqn{\mathcal{I}} would be reached under some
assumptions about the nuisance parameters.
