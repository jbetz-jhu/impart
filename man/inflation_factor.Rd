\title{Adjust Information Target for a Group Sequential Design}
\usage{
required_information_sequential(information_single_stage, trial_design)

get_gsd_inflation_factor(trial_design)
}
\arguments{
\item{information_single_stage}{A numeric scalar containing the information level
for an information monitored design with a single efficacy analysis, created
using \link{required_information_single_stage}}

\item{trial_design}{An object of type \code{trialDesignGroupSequential}
created by \link[rpact:getDesignGroupSequential]{rpact::getDesignGroupSequential} containing a group sequential
design specification}
}
\value{
\code{get_gsd_inflation_factor} returns a \code{numeric} scalar
containing the inflation factor, and \code{required_information_sequential}
returns a \code{numeric} scalar containing the information target accounting
for the pre-planned analyses specified in \code{trial_design}.
}
\description{
Group Sequential Design methods can control the Familywise Type I Error
(FWER) due to multiple assessments of efficacy and allow for futility
stopping. Interim stopping can potentially reduce the average length of a
study, often requiring only a modest increase in the maximum potential sample
size. The method used to adjust the sample size of a single stage design
to account for multiplicity can also be used to adjust the information target
of an information monitored design.

\details{
It is often advantageous to perform pre-planned interim analyses during a
trial to assess whether the efficacy of treatments has already been
established, or whether it is futile to continue collecting data. Group
Sequential Designs are a principled way of carrying out such studies that
control familywise type I error. The use of \eqn{\alpha}-spending functions
allow for stopping boundaries to be adjusted to the amount of data collected.

When there are assessments for efficacy or futility, achieving the same level
of power and type I error requires an increase in sample size. This
"inflation factor" depends on the number of analyses (often denoted \eqn{K})
and type of stopping boundaries chosen (often denoted as a "shape parameter"
\eqn{\Delta}).

\code{get_gsd_inflation_factor} extracts the "inflation factor" from a
group sequential design created by \link[rpact:getDesignGroupSequential]{rpact::getDesignGroupSequential}.
\code{required_information_sequential} takes in an information target
\eqn{\mathcal{I}} for a single-stage design (no interim analyses of
efficacy), and a group sequential design specification, and returns an
information target \eqn{\mathcal{I}_{GSD}} for an information monitored
design with group sequential stopping for efficacy and/or futility.
