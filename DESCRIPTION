Description: Software for designing, monitoring, and analyzing experiments
    with covariate adjustment, including fixed sample size designs, group
    sequential designs with interim assessments of efficacy and futility,
    as well as information monitoring designs (i.e. designs whose sample
    size is automatically adjusted to the precision of the accruing data).
    Analyses can include covariate adjustment which can potentially improve power
    and precision in group sequential and fixed sample size designs, and shorten
    the duration of information monitored designs. Estimates can be
    orthogonalized to provide the 'independent increments' assumption which
    underpins the valid use of group sequential stopping boundaries.
